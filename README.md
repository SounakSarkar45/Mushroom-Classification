his dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy. The Mushroom classification project showcased the effectiveness of the Logistic Regression model with an impressive accuracy of 95%. Additionally, the Naive Bayes model achieved a commendable accuracy of 91%. However, caution should be exercised when considering the Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. While these models exhibited higher accuracy rates, they demonstrated signs of overfitting the data, suggesting that they may not generalize well to unseen samples. The superior performance of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models emphasizes their suitability for the Mushroom classification task, offering reliable and robust results.
